## NOTE
1. ~~If you have compile issues with boost(_MSVC_LANG), make sure you are using vs2017 15.7.x or newer.~~
2. use 32bit node to install 32bit electron (game overlay support x64 no matter electron version), if you want to use 64bit electron, modify compile:electron script in client/package.json.
3. we can assocciate a new IME conext if game disabled it, but in fullscreen it will cause window to lose focus.
